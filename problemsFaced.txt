1. Audit System Setup and Configuration Issues:
Audit Rule Setup:

You encountered problems while configuring auditd rules and attempting to monitor syscalls in real-time.

Initially, auditctl was only showing one audit rule: -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve, which limits monitoring to just the execve syscall. This might have led to missing other critical syscalls for intrusion detection.

Audit Rule Upgrade:

You attempted to upgrade or refine audit rules to capture more syscall activities, but the system wasn’t reflecting the changes properly, and you received warnings like "auditctl command not found" or improper rule registrations.

Solution: You had to ensure that auditd was restarted correctly, and rules were updated, but at times the changes did not take effect, indicating possible issues with the system’s configuration or the need for specific permissions (root or auditd service configuration).

2. Real-time Monitoring of Syscalls:
Missed Syscalls:

While attempting to extract syscalls in real-time, there were instances where certain syscalls were missed or not captured properly.

Inconsistent data capture or delays between syscall execution and detection were noted. It could be attributed to either the system not fully processing syscalls or buffering issues.

Limited Syscall Activity:

During the monitoring, you observed a repetitive sequence of syscalls (like 257, 59, 41, 49), but only these few syscalls were captured. This indicated that the system might not be monitoring all syscalls or was limited in scope.

Solution: You needed to adjust the audit rules to capture more diverse syscalls or extend the system’s capabilities for real-time analysis. Ensuring broader syscall captures with rules such as -S execve, -S open would help.

3. Issues with Model Prediction:
Frequent False Negatives (Normal Predictions):

Your machine learning model consistently predicted "normal" (0) for various syscall activities, even when the syscalls exhibited different sequences.

Despite changes in syscall patterns, the model did not classify them as malicious (1), which raised concerns about the model’s accuracy and ability to detect anomalies.

Lack of Sensitivity:

The model did not show sensitivity to abnormal syscall activity. This points to the possibility that the model was either not trained with sufficient malicious activity examples or the features it was using were not capturing malicious behaviors effectively.

In some cases, syscalls were predicted as normal, despite having malicious or suspicious sequences that the model should ideally recognize.

4. Model Training Data and Feature Extraction Issues:
Imbalanced Data:

It was suggested that your training data might be imbalanced, with more "normal" syscall data than "malicious" data. An imbalance in the dataset can result in a biased model that tends to favor the majority class (normal).

Solution: You would need to balance the dataset by either sampling more malicious data or applying techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to the normal data to ensure both classes are adequately represented.

Feature Extraction:

The model relied heavily on a fixed window of syscall history (e.g., a sliding window of 10 syscalls). However, the features might not have been sufficient to distinguish complex attack behaviors.

Solution: You could enhance the feature set by considering additional contextual features, such as the frequency of syscalls, the time between syscall executions, the relationship between syscalls, or even behavioral analysis of processes.

Thresholding Issues:

It seems like the threshold for classification might be set too strictly, where only extreme patterns of behavior are flagged as malicious. This could lead to "normal" being predicted for subtle but potentially malicious activities.

Solution: You might need to adjust the model's decision threshold, especially if you’re working with classification models that require tuning for precision and recall.

5. Model’s Lack of Contextual Understanding:
Sequence Sensitivity:

The model does not seem to understand the temporal dependencies between syscalls well. In intrusion detection systems (IDS), the sequence and order of syscalls matter, and models like LSTM or attention-based networks could better capture these dependencies.

Solution: You might consider switching to a model that can better handle sequences, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Transformer-based models, which are better at learning patterns in time-series data like syscall sequences.

6. Model Evaluation and Prediction Debugging:
Model Evaluation Logs:

The logs indicate a series of predicted syscall sequences, but there is no indication of malicious behavior being detected, even when patterns change. The system is marking activities as normal without any flagged anomalies.

Solution: You need to evaluate the model’s performance with a confusion matrix, checking the False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), True Positive (TP), and True Negative (TN) rates to better understand where the model’s weaknesses are.

7. Operational Monitoring:
Monitoring System Performance:

Your monitoring system (auditd, real-time syscall tracking) might be generating logs, but those logs weren’t being processed efficiently by the ML model. This suggests that the integration between the real-time data collection and the ML model could be a point of failure.

Solution: You should ensure that the real-time data collection pipeline is properly integrated with the model, maybe by setting up an asynchronous or buffered system that ensures timely data transfer to the model for analysis.

Next Steps for Resolving the Issues:
Re-training the Model:

Train the model with balanced data, ensuring sufficient samples for both normal and malicious activities.

Adjust feature engineering to better capture syscall relationships, frequencies, and patterns.

Use time-series models like LSTM for better sequence prediction and temporal understanding.

Improving Audit Configuration:

Fine-tune your audit rules to capture a wider range of syscalls and ensure no important syscalls are missed during real-time monitoring.

Consider using more detailed rules for specific syscalls and their parameters to get better insights into potential attacks.

Debugging Model:

Evaluate the model's performance with proper evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, precision, recall).

Adjust thresholds and model parameters to increase sensitivity to malicious behavior.

Optimize Data Collection Pipeline:

Ensure that your data collection (syscall extraction) integrates smoothly with the ML model and that logs are processed in real-time without any loss of data.
